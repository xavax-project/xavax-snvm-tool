# xavax-snvm-tool

### NOTE:
snvm-tool uses a very nightly xavax-avalanche library, for now it's embedded directly
in the same project, this will change soon though.

## Some Use(less)ful information:

<h3 align="center"> What's snvm-tool? It's an acronym:</h3>

* sn:   `subnet`
* vm:   `virtual machine`
* tool: `tool`

<h3 align="center"> What do you do with the snvm-tool?</h3>

You create [subnets](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/subnets)
on the decentralized [avalanche](https://docs.avax.network) network.
A subnet is a set of validators.

On this subnet, you can further add custom blockchains or DAGs running custom virtual machines. For instance, you can create a virtual machine that helps you quell the pain of life, or create a customized EVM, or maybe a WASM vm, anything your sweet little heart desires really;

snvm-tool provides a fairly straight-forward cli/terminal-interface for doing this stuff. Although, its extremely early at the time of writing this readme, it doesn't do much except give you the ability to
create a subnet & add custom chains to it, it's going to be a nice complementary tool for future SDKs, it also serves as a nice example of the [xavax-avalanche](https://github.com/xavax-project/xavax-avalanche) SDK

<h3 align="center">How does snvm-tool work?</h3>

The snvm-tool also acts as a nice example of how to use the the xavax-avalanche SDK, there will hopefully be some documentation explaining the tool and how it works in the documentation. 
[xavax docs](httsp://docs.xavax.io) soon enough...

### Instructions:


<h3 align="center">Why?</h3>

So I & others can experiment with creating custom virtual-machines,
and also create an example for the usage of [xavax-avalanche](https://crates.io/crates/xavax-avalanche) lib.

## xavax
xavax project creates open source software & tools, such as the [Vulture multi-chain wallet](https://vulturewallet.net), check it out!
